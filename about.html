                    worked at Facebook and Google.
                    I love thinking and designing with challenges beyond the existing
                    rules. Thus, I've been so interested in new technologies and designs, such as VR/AR and flexible
                    wearable devices. Meanwhile, I've been photographing for three years. I love driving down towards an
                    abstract destination with friends, stopping by anywhere that "worths" a stop, and waiting to capture
                    the scene at a perfect moment.</p>
